#FPS_Journey

Goals For this project:
 * Clean the Code up, and optimze it as well 
    * Clean up the Entity-Component-System (I think using a hash table for the components might work better, and try to use pointers to
         reference the original entity ID)
   * Also I want to make it where I can import information from a text file or xml about a zombie or wall and it has all the data for it.
 * optimize the collision system
    * Hill Climbing for the support functions of the Convex regions
    * Better Grid system (Need to experiemnt with different ideas for now)
    * Account for different kinds of objects
        * Spheres are good for certain objects while AABB are better (depends on the situation) I like spheres for the orientation aspect, 
        * but the AABB is fine, just map to one local coordinate system if needed (I already do this for the GJK Algorthim)
    * Need to make sure that flat planes (the Walls) can not be tunneled as easily
 * Physics system
      
 * Animation
    * Look at Inverse/Forward Kinematics
    * Blending of Animation together
