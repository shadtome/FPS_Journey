/*
This class is used to import all model information using ASSIMP.  This importing process depends on what kind of file system,
since different file systems have different coordinate systems.

If the model has a skeleton, it imports that as well, includeing all the inverse bind poses, which are included in the skeleton system
in the process of find the total transforms of the joints.

If the model has animations as well, this imports these as well, and holds the data in this class
